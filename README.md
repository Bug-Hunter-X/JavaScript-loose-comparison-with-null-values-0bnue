# JavaScript Loose Comparison with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose comparison (==) with null values.  Loose comparison can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with null or undefined.

The `bug.js` file shows a function with potential errors, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using strict equality (===) for robust null handling.  The solution ensures accurate behavior and avoids unexpected outputs.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files in a text editor or IDE.
3. Run the JavaScript code using Node.js or a web browser's console.

Observe the output differences between the original buggy code and the corrected solution.
